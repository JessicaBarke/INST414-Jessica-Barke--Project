Students' Social Media Addiction,,"A Cross-Country Survey of Usage Patterns, Academic Impact, and Relationship ","### Overview  The **Student Social Media & Relationships** dataset contains anonymized records of students’ social‐media behaviors and related life outcomes. It spans multiple countries and academic levels, focusing on key dimensions such as usage intensity, platform preferences, and relationship dynamics. Each row represents one student’s survey response, offering a cross‐sectional snapshot suitable for statistical analysis and machine‐learning applications.  ### Scope & Coverage  * **Population:** Students aged 16–25 enrolled in high school, undergraduate, or graduate programs. * **Geography:** Multi‐country coverage (e.g., Bangladesh, India, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Japan, South Korea). * **Timeframe:** Data collected via a one‐time online survey administered in Q1 2025. * **Volume:** Configurable sample sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1,000 records) based on research needs.  ### Data Collection & Methodology  1. **Survey Design:** Questions adapted from validated scales on social‐media addiction (e.g., Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale) and relationship conflict indices. 2. **Recruitment:** Participants recruited through university mailing lists and social‐media platforms, ensuring diversity in academic level and country. 3. **Data Quality Controls:**     * **Validation:** Mandatory fields and range checks (e.g., usage hours between 0–24).    * **De‐duplication:** Removal of duplicate entries via unique Student\_ID checks.    * **Anonymization:** No personally identifiable information collected.  ### Key Variables  | Variable                       | Type        | Description                                           | | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | | Student\_ID                    | Integer     | Unique respondent identifier                          | | Age                            | Integer     | Age in years                                          | | Gender                         | Categorical | “Male” or “Female”                                    | | Academic\_Level                | Categorical | High School / Undergraduate / Graduate                | | Country                        | Categorical | Country of residence                                  | | Avg\_Daily\_Usage\_Hours       | Float       | Average hours per day on social media                 | | Most\_Used\_Platform           | Categorical | Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc.                     | | Affects\_Academic\_Performance | Boolean     | Self‐reported impact on academics (Yes/No)            | | Sleep\_Hours\_Per\_Night       | Float       | Average nightly sleep hours                           | | Mental\_Health\_Score          | Integer     | Self‐rated mental health (1 = poor to 10 = excellent) | | Relationship\_Status           | Categorical | Single / In Relationship / Complicated                | | Conflicts\_Over\_Social\_Media | Integer     | Number of relationship conflicts due to social media  | | Addicted\_Score                | Integer     | Social Media Addiction Score (1 = low to 10 = high)   |  ### Potential Analyses  * **Correlation Studies:** Examine associations between daily usage hours and mental‐health score or sleep hours. * **Predictive Modeling:** Build classifiers to predict relationship conflicts based on usage patterns and platform type. * **Clustering:** Identify user segments (e.g., “high‐usage high‐stress” vs. “moderate‐usage balanced”) across countries.  ### Limitations  * **Self‐Report Bias:** All measures are self‐reported and may be subject to social‐desirability effects. * **Cross‐Sectional Design:** One‐time survey prevents causal inference. * **Sampling Variability:** Recruitment via online channels may underrepresent students with limited internet access.
