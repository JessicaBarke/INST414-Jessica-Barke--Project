Social Media vs Productivity,,Impact of Social Media Usage on Individual Productivity,"# 📊 Social Media vs Productivity — Realistic Behavioral Dataset (30,000 Users)  This dataset explores how **daily digital habits** — including social media usage, screen time, and notification exposure — relate to individual **productivity, stress, and well-being**.  ### 🔍 What’s Inside? The dataset contains **30,000 real-world-style records** simulating behavioral patterns of people with various jobs, social habits, and lifestyle choices. The goal is to understand how different **digital behaviors** correlate with **perceived and actual productivity**.  ---  ## 🧠 Why This Dataset is Valuable  - ✅ **Designed for real-world ML workflows**     Includes missing values, noise, and outliers — ideal for practicing data cleaning and preprocessing.    - 🔗 **High correlation between target features**     The `perceived_productivity_score` and `actual_productivity_score` are strongly correlated, making this dataset suitable for experiments in **feature selection and multicollinearity**.  - 🛠️ **Feature Engineering playground**     Use this dataset to practice feature scaling, encoding, binning, interaction terms, and more.  - 🧪 **Perfect for EDA, regression & classification**     You can model productivity, stress, or satisfaction based on behavior patterns and digital exposure.  ---  ## 🧾 Columns & Feature Info  | Column Name                        | Description                                                                 | |------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `age`                              | Age of the individual (18–65 years)                                        | | `gender`                           | Gender identity: Male, Female, or Other                                    | | `job_type`                         | Employment sector or status (IT, Education, Student, etc.)                 | | `daily_social_media_time`          | Average daily time spent on social media (hours)                           | | `social_platform_preference`       | Most-used social platform (Instagram, TikTok, Telegram, etc.)              | | `number_of_notifications`          | Number of mobile/social notifications per day                              | | `work_hours_per_day`               | Average hours worked each day                                              | | `perceived_productivity_score`     | Self-rated productivity score (scale: 0–10)                                | | `actual_productivity_score`        | Simulated ground-truth productivity score (scale: 0–10)                    | | `stress_level`                     | Current stress level (scale: 1–10)                                         | | `sleep_hours`                      | Average hours of sleep per night                                           | | `screen_time_before_sleep`         | Time spent on screens before sleeping (hours)                              | | `breaks_during_work`               | Number of breaks taken during work hours                                   | | `uses_focus_apps`                  | Whether the user uses digital focus apps (True/False)                      | | `has_digital_wellbeing_enabled`    | Whether Digital Wellbeing is activated (True/False)                        | | `coffee_consumption_per_day`       | Number of coffee cups consumed per day                                     | | `days_feeling_burnout_per_month`   | Number of burnout days reported per month                                  | | `weekly_offline_hours`             | Total hours spent offline each week (excluding sleep)                      | | `job_satisfaction_score`           | Satisfaction with job/life responsibilities (scale: 0–10)                  |  ---  ## 📌 Notes  - Contains **NaN values** in critical columns (productivity, sleep, stress) for data imputation tasks   - Includes **outliers** in media usage, coffee intake, and notification count   - Target columns are **strongly correlated** for multicollinearity testing   - Multi-purpose: regression, classification, clustering, visualization  ---  ## 💡 Use Cases  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   - Feature engineering pipelines   - Machine learning model benchmarking   - Statistical hypothesis testing   - Burnout and mental health prediction projects  ---  ## 📥 Bonus  👉 Sample notebook coming soon with data cleaning, visualization, and productivity prediction!
